## Adventure Game
![aid](https://github.com/WibblyWall/WibblyWall.GitHub.io/issues/1#issue-2247176516)
In this game I demonstrate my skills in making a text based adventure game
Using multiple classes and moving information in between the different classes(The Engine class is used as the hub).
Storing Player data and information like name and items the player has in the Player and Inventory classes.
And the ability to have the player pick where they want to go using the Locations class.

A personal project I have started using the knowlage I learned from my text based adventure game.
Showing the uses of bools and floats very heavily.
Also using vectors, getbuttondown, and IEnumerators.
